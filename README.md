This is a Python script whose purpose is to reverse-engineer a Metasploit payload for Android to add several features, including:
✅ All files are embedded in the script
✅ No need for external files
✅ Direct execution with a single command
✅ Ready-to-use output

What it modifies in the original payload: data theft from targeted applications — messaging (WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, etc.), email (Gmail, etc.), social media (Twitter, Facebook), browser (browsing history, bookmarks), core data (contacts, messages, calls), live remote spying, voice eavesdropping (microphone), camera (front/back), screenshots, keylogging, additional communication protocols: SMS/MMS for commands, MQTT, WAP Push, phone calls for activation, advanced control features, specific commands (0, 1, 4, 6, 8, etc.), advanced “suicide” mechanisms, emulator detection, native components.

Polished/professional English description
A Python script designed to modify and rebuild a Metasploit Android payload to add multiple capabilities:

✅ All required files packaged within the script (no external files needed)

✅ Single-command execution with ready-to-use output

Enhanced payload capabilities include: extraction of data from target apps (messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Viber, Skype; email clients such as Gmail; social networks like Twitter and Facebook), browser artifacts (history, bookmarks), core device data (contacts, SMS, call logs), live remote surveillance, audio eavesdropping (microphone), camera access (front and rear), screenshots, keystroke logging, support for additional command channels/protocols (SMS/MMS, MQTT, WAP Push), phone-call activation, advanced remote control commands (examples: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8…), sophisticated self-destruct (“suicide”) mechanisms, emulator detection, and inclusion of native (compiled) components.
